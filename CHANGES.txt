# PyAnEn 0.2.1

- Added new module `Grid`
- Add name decoding to `IO.open_dataset` when `num_chars` is present. This dataset is usually generated from `R`.



I want a verification class that:

1. input should be observation and forecasts
1. can calculate various verification metrics
1. can specify different average dimension
1. can select whether to boot
1. can deal with xarray format
1. save intermediate results to speed up recalculation

# PyAnEn 0.1.2

- Deep copy values from root groups when opening files to avoid IO errors
- Added `IO.open_dataset`
- Added verification functions: `crps`, `bias`, and `bias`
- Initialized the project
